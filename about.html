	<p>Hi, I'm Jos√© Coto. I am currently based in Berlin, where I work as a Data Analyst freelancer. I use data for understanding social and individual behavior. In my analyses, I really enjoy working with Python and its related scientific and statistic libraries. I am a big believer in making complicated things simple. That's why I am passionate user of visualizations to make sense of my analysis and to communicate my results.</p>

	<p>Two of the things I enjoy the most is learning and teaching. Personally, I found it quite daunting trying to make sense of all the data analysis tools out there. I created this blog to keep track of the things I am learning with the hope it will help others too. Feel free to check my current projects or contact me.</p>
